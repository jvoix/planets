Prof. Voix leads the NSERC-EERS Industrial Research Chair in In-Ear Technologies (CRITIAS) for the development of 
leading-edge technology combining in-ear instrumented hardware platforms with audio signal processing and biosignal 
extraction algorithms to enable its Canadian industrial partner, EERS Global Technologies Inc., to commercialize 
in-ear wearables for hearing protection, hearing aid, two-way communication and brain-computer interfaces for 
industrial, military, consumer and medical markets. CRITIAS core research activities will include 4 areas of 
expertise: a) digital hearing protection, b) communication in noise, c) in-ear sensing. He also carries a 
separate line of research on human earcanal characterization towards a long-term project of micro-energy harvesting 
for in-ear wearables, and d) in-ear energy harvesting.
